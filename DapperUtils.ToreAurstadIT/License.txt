The Dapper logo is copyright Marc Gravell 2021 onwards; it is fine to use the Dapper logo when referencing the Dapper library and utilities, but
the Dapper logo (including derivatives) must not be used in a way that misrepresents an external product or library as being affiliated or endorsed
with Dapper. For example, you must not use the Dapper logo as the package icon on your own external tool (even if it uses Dapper internally),
without written permission. If in doubt: ask.
